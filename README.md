## Web Hosting

#### 1. Configure Your Server:

- Ensure that your server environment is properly configured to serve web content. This includes installing necessary software like a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and configuring it to serve files from the correct directories.

#### 2. Copy the www Folder to Your Desired Web Server Root Directory:

- Download the Project.
- Copy the entire contents of the www folder to the root directory of your web server.
- This root directory is typically named public_html, htdocs, www, or similar, depending on your server configuration.
- Ensure that the file permissions are set correctly to allow the web server to access and serve these files.
- Verify that the files are accessible by navigating to your server's URL in a web browser.

#### 3. Check File and Directory Permissions:

- Ensure that the files and directories in your web server root directory have the correct permissions set. Directories should typically have permissions of 755 (rwxr-xr-x), and files should have permissions of 644 (rw-r--r--). You can adjust permissions using the chmod command.

#### 4. Configure Server Settings:

- Check your server configuration files (e.g., Apache's httpd.conf, Nginx's configuration files) to ensure they are correctly set up to serve files from the desired directory.
- Verify that any virtual hosts or server blocks are properly configured to point to the correct root directory.

#### 5. Test Your Website:
        
- Once the files are copied and the server is properly configured, test your website by navigating to its URL in a web browser.
- Check for any errors or issues that may arise during loading or navigation.
- If you encounter errors, refer to your server logs for more information on the cause of the problem.
